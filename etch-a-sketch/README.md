# etch-a-sketch
This repo consists of my work for a pseudo etch-a-sketch as part of an assignment under The Odin Project. 
The html site is built based upon css and javascript. 
The main ideas behind this project is to replicate what one would see in a physical etch-a-sketch notebook, and further enhancing it with a random color generator option, as well as, giving the user an option to resize their drawing pad as they like.
